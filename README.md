# Rice Map â€“ Gummawala (Kharif 2024)

This repository hosts the rice classification map for the Gummawala region (Uttarakhand) for the Kharif 2024 season. The classification was performed using Sentinel-2 imagery and an object-based approach on segmented field parcels. Yield estimates were generated using an empirical model trained on ground truth data, leveraging peak-season NDVI values.
